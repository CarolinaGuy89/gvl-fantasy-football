This project is current under development.

This started as a learning project to simply learn some basic Javascript and it turned into so much more. It started with a desire to some how allow some friends and I to digitially live draft for fantasy football.  From there, I discovered a third party ESPN API.  In my attempt to understand how that is even used, I browsed other's repo's until I came across ( name/link)'s repo.  This was shocking to me how much could be done using Javascript alone.

Since then it lead me down the path to discover ReactJS, and through that I discovered NextJS as well.  After some moderate success and a tremendous amount of learning, I decided to rebuild without NextJS due to API issues I was dealing with.
